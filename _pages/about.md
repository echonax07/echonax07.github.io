Hello! I'm Muhammed Patel, a passionate engineer specializing in Systems Design Engineering with a keen interest in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Currently, I'm advancing my computer vision skills and knowledge at the University of Waterloo, focusing on cutting-edge technologies and research in remote sensing. When I'm not immersed in technology, I love to stay active through calisthenics, unwind with video games, or play sports. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow both professionally and personally.


Hello! I am Muhammed Patel I am a graduate student pursuing a MaSc in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Prior to this, I completed a dual degree program in Industrial Engineering with a specialization in Optimization at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. I am currently working on automatic whale detection and sea ice classification from SAR images.
